considerations:
  tweet_filtering:
    description: "We shall not be showing the user tweets that they already swiped on"
    implementation:
      1. store swiped tweets in user_interactions collection
      2. query user_interactions to check if tweet was swiped
      3. exclude swiped tweets from feed display
      4. display swiped tweets in collection tab via user_interactions query

    database_related:
      rankings:
        description: "Author ranking system based on tweet swipes"
        implementation:
          - each swipe earns points for the tweet author
          - authors ranked by total swipe points
          - data stored in author_points collection
          - points updated in real-time per swipe
          - data_model:
              author_id: "unique identifier"
              author_name: "display name"
              author_username: "twitter handle"
              points: "total swipe points"
              last_updated: "timestamp of last update"
      
      tweets:
        fetching: "tweets fetched from MongoDB"
        relations:
          - related to author_points for swipe-based ranking
          - related to user_interactions for collection display
        categories:
          - displayed based on user onboarding choices
          - stored in user_preferences collection

      referral system:
        - share links
        - share card
      
      onboarding experience:
        - finalize the categories and tags
