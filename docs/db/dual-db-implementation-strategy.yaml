    # Event-Driven Communication Files
    - path: "src/lib/events/EventBus.ts"
      purpose: "Central event bus implementation for cross-database communication"
      reasoning: "Implements publish-subscribe pattern to decouple database operations, following standard event-driven architecture practices"
      detailed_explanation: "The EventBus implements the Observer pattern, allowing components to subscribe to specific events without knowing about the publishers. This decoupling means that when you save a user interaction in MongoDB, you can simply emit a 'UserInteractionRecorded' event without knowing which PostgreSQL tables need to be updated. This makes the system more maintainable and extensible - you can add new event handlers without modifying existing code."
    
    - path: "src/lib/events/events.ts"
      purpose: "Type definitions for all application events"
      reasoning: "Centralizes event type definitions to ensure type safety and consistency across event publishers and subscribers"
      detailed_explanation: "TypeScript interfaces for events provide compile-time safety, preventing errors like misspelling event names or passing incorrect data structures. Centralizing these definitions ensures that all parts of the application have a consistent understanding of what data each event contains. This is especially important in a dual-database system where events need to carry enough information for handlers to update both databases correctly."
    
    - path: "src/lib/events/handlers/PostgresEventHandler.ts"
      purpose: "Handles events that require PostgreSQL updates"
      reasoning: "Separates PostgreSQL-specific event handling logic, following single responsibility principle"
      detailed_explanation: "By isolating PostgreSQL-specific logic in dedicated handlers, we can optimize queries for PostgreSQL's strengths (joins, transactions, constraints) without polluting the MongoDB interaction code. This separation also makes it easier to test PostgreSQL operations independently and to swap out PostgreSQL implementations in the future if needed."
    
    - path: "src/lib/events/handlers/MongoEventHandler.ts"
      purpose: "Handles events that require MongoDB updates"
      reasoning: "Separates MongoDB-specific event handling logic, maintaining clean separation of concerns"
      detailed_explanation: "MongoDB excels at document operations and flexible schema designs. By keeping MongoDB-specific logic separate, we can leverage MongoDB features like atomic document updates, embedded documents, and flexible querying without being constrained by relational database patterns. This also allows for MongoDB-specific optimizations like bulk operations."
    
    # Database Abstraction Layer Files
    - path: "src/lib/db/services/UserService.ts"
      purpose: "Coordinates user data operations across both databases"
      reasoning: "Provides a unified interface for user-related operations, abstracting the underlying database complexity"
      detailed_explanation: "The UserService acts as a facade that hides the complexity of coordinating two databases. Application code can simply call 'userService.getUserProfile(userId)' without knowing that the profile data comes from PostgreSQL while preferences come from MongoDB. This abstraction makes the rest of the application simpler and protects it from changes in the database architecture."
    
    - path: "src/lib/db/services/ContentService.ts"
      purpose: "Manages content retrieval and filtering operations"
      reasoning: "Centralizes content-related logic and implements efficient querying strategies for MongoDB"
      detailed_explanation: "The ContentService encapsulates all tweet-related operations, including complex queries that leverage MongoDB's document structure. It can implement features like text search, category filtering, and recommendation algorithms while hiding the complexity of MongoDB queries from the rest of the application. This service can also implement caching strategies specific to content data."
    
    - path: "src/lib/db/services/AnalyticsService.ts"
      purpose: "Handles analytics data aggregation and synchronization"
      reasoning: "Encapsulates batch processing logic and provides consistent analytics data across databases"
      detailed_explanation: "Analytics often require aggregating data from both databases, which is a perfect use case for batch processing. The AnalyticsService can run periodic jobs to compute statistics, update leaderboards, and synchronize data between databases without impacting real-time operations. This separation ensures that analytics work doesn't interfere with user-facing operations."
    
    - path: "src/lib/db/services/CacheService.ts"
      purpose: "Implements intelligent caching strategies"
      reasoning: "Centralizes caching logic with proper TTL management and invalidation strategies"
      detailed_explanation: "A well-designed cache can dramatically reduce database load and improve response times. The CacheService implements strategies like LRU eviction, cache warming, and smart invalidation. In a dual-database system, it's especially important to have a unified caching layer that can handle data from both sources while maintaining consistency."
    
    # Monitoring and Instrumentation Files
    - path: "src/lib/monitoring/MetricsCollector.ts"
      purpose: "Collects and reports performance metrics"
      reasoning: "Implements application-level metrics collection following observability best practices"
      detailed_explanation: "In a dual-database system, it's crucial to monitor performance metrics separately for each database as well as for cross-database operations. The MetricsCollector can track things like query latency, cache hit ratios, and error rates. This data is essential for identifying bottlenecks and understanding the impact of database coordination overhead."
    
    - path: "src/lib/monitoring/Logger.ts"
      purpose: "Centralized logging implementation"
      reasoning: "Provides structured logging with appropriate levels and context for debugging and monitoring"
      detailed_explanation: "Structured logging with consistent formats makes it much easier to debug issues in a complex system. The Logger can automatically include context like user IDs, request IDs, and database operation details. In a dual-database system, having consistent logging across both databases is essential for tracing the flow of operations."
    
    # Configuration Files
    - path: "src/config/database.ts"
      purpose: "Database connection and configuration settings"
      reasoning: "Centralizes database configuration following the configuration-as-code principle"
      detailed_explanation: "Having database configuration in code rather than environment variables makes it easier to manage complex setups and ensures consistency across environments. This file can include connection pooling settings, retry policies, and other database-specific configurations that might differ between MongoDB and PostgreSQL."
    
    - path: "src/config/cache.ts"
      purpose: "Caching configuration and policies"
      reasoning: "Separates caching configuration from implementation for easier tuning and management"
      detailed_explanation: "Cache policies often need to be tuned based on usage patterns and performance requirements. By separating configuration from implementation, you can adjust TTL values, cache sizes, and eviction strategies without changing code. This is particularly important in a dual-database system where different types of data might have different caching requirements."
    
    # Error Handling Files
    - path: "src/lib/errors/DatabaseError.ts"
      purpose: "Custom error classes for database operations"
      reasoning: "Implements specific error types for better error handling and debugging"
      detailed_explanation: "Different databases and operations can fail in different ways. Custom error types allow you to handle these failures appropriately - for example, retrying transient network errors or failing fast on constraint violations. In a dual-database system, it's especially important to distinguish between errors from different databases to implement appropriate recovery strategies."
    
    - path: "src/lib/errors/ErrorHandler.ts"
      purpose: "Centralized error handling and reporting"
      reasoning: "Implements consistent error handling patterns across database operations"
      detailed_explanation: "Centralized error handling ensures that all database operations are treated consistently. This is particularly important for cross-database operations where you might need to implement rollback strategies or compensating transactions when one database operation succeeds and another fails."
    
    # Batch Processing Files
    - path: "src/lib/batch/BatchProcessor.ts"
      purpose: "Implements batch processing for analytics data"
      reasoning: "Encapsulates batch processing logic with checkpointing and error handling"
      detailed_explanation: "Batch processing is ideal for operations that don't need to be real-time, like analytics aggregation or data synchronization. The BatchProcessor can implement checkpointing to ensure progress is not lost if the process fails, and can handle partial failures gracefully. This approach is much more efficient than trying to keep data in sync in real-time."
    
    - path: "src/lib/batch/schedulers/AnalyticsScheduler.ts"
      purpose: "Schedules and manages analytics batch jobs"
      reasoning: "Separates scheduling concerns from processing logic following separation of concerns principle"
      detailed_explanation: "Scheduling is a separate concern from the actual processing logic. The AnalyticsScheduler can handle complexities like ensuring jobs don't overlap, running jobs at optimal times, and handling failures. This separation makes both the scheduling and processing logic easier to understand and maintain."
    
    # API Integration Files
    - path: "src/app/api/events/route.ts"
      purpose: "API endpoint for external event triggering"
      reasoning: "Provides HTTP interface for event-driven operations, following REST API conventions"
      detailed_explanation: "While most events will be triggered internally by database operations, it can be useful to have an API endpoint for testing and integration with external systems. This endpoint can also serve as a way to manually trigger operations for debugging or administrative purposes."
    
    - path: "src/app/api/batch/trigger/route.ts"
      purpose: "API endpoint for manually triggering batch processes"
      reasoning: "Allows manual triggering of batch jobs for testing and administration purposes"
      detailed_explanation: "During development and testing, you'll often want to manually trigger batch jobs rather than waiting for scheduled execution. This endpoint provides a convenient way to do that. It's also useful for operational tasks like reprocessing data after fixing a bug."
    
    # Testing Files
    - path: "src/__tests__/integration/database.integration.test.ts"
      purpose: "Integration tests for cross-database operations"
      reasoning: "Ensures database coordination works correctly in realistic scenarios"
      detailed_explanation: "Integration tests are crucial for a dual-database system because the complexity lies in how the databases work together, not in each database individually. These tests can verify that events properly trigger updates in both databases, that data remains consistent, and that error handling works correctly."
    
    - path: "src/__tests__/unit/services/UserService.test.ts"
      purpose: "Unit tests for UserService"
      reasoning: "Verifies correct behavior of database abstraction layer components"
      detailed_explanation: "Unit tests for the database abstraction layer can use mocks to test the coordination logic without requiring actual database connections. These tests can verify that the right operations are performed on each database and that errors are handled correctly."
    
    # Documentation Files
    - path: "docs/db/architecture.md"
      purpose: "Detailed architecture documentation for the dual-database system"
      reasoning: "Provides comprehensive documentation for developers and future maintainers"
      detailed_explanation: "A dual-database system is inherently more complex than a single-database system, so good documentation is essential. This document should explain the data flow, consistency models, failure scenarios, and operational procedures. It will be invaluable for onboarding new team members and for making future architectural decisions."
